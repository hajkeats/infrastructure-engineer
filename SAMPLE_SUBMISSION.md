## Replication steps

```bash
# How do I prepare my environment?
# How do I run the code?
```

## Questions

1. Why could it be a problem to have deployments that donâ€™t specify their requirements?
2. Is there a better way to check deployments than periodically calling the API server?
3. Are there any existing tools we could use instead? Why might we write our own tool?
